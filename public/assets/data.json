Learn to control yourself and do your job or find another profession.<p>TITLE 18, U.S.C., SECTION 242\nDEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF LAW<p><i>Acts under \u201ccolor of any law\u201d include acts not only done by federal, state, or local officials within the bounds or limits of their lawful authority, but also acts done without and beyond the bounds of their lawful authority; provided that, in order for unlawful acts of any official to be done under \u201ccolor of any law,\u201d the unlawful acts must be done while such official is purporting or pretending to act in the performance of his&#x2F;her official duties. This definition includes, in addition to law enforcement officials, individuals such as Mayors, Council persons, Judges, Nursing Home Proprietors, Security Guards, etc., persons who are bound by laws, statutes ordinances, or customs.</i><p>This means Chauvin could say he was acting under the &quot;color of law&quot; when he attempted to restrain George Floyd and during his restraint is when Floyd died. Because Chauvin was acting as a police officer and not a legal citizen, it was within his official duty as a police officer to apprehend someone who is breaking the law.<p>However, in the initial part of the statue, it clearly states:<p><i>This law further prohibits a person acting under color of law, statute, ordinance, regulation or custom to willfully subject or cause to be subjected any person to different punishments, pains, or penalties, than those prescribed for punishment of citizens on account of such person being an alien or by reason of his&#x2F;her color or race.</i><p>This also means the prosecution can simply say that Chauvin was a known racist and violent around black people and his restraint was not an approved technique for restraining or arresting someone, therefore, based on those facts, the prosecution can make a compelling case that Chauvin attempted to use &quot;color of law&quot; to cover his willful infliction and in doing so, deprived George Floyd of his civil rights while doing so.<p>The shorter answer is yes, they can lose their temper because it might be required in the application of their duties as a police officer and officer of the government for which they serve. No, in that they cannot abuse that power and use &quot;color of law&quot; to deprive someone of their civil rights under the constitution.",

This is not just about police attacks against journalists across the U.S. in general, this is about attacks since a specific date. The date matters because it is recent, it delineates a specific span of time (a mere five days), which helps the reader place it into context. This is about the protests that have occurred since the murder of George Floyd.<p>2. This is not just about some rare occurrence of police attacks against journalists since a specific date, this is about how this happened many, many times, and as the article notes, in the majority of the cases the journalists were clearly identifiable as press. This places it in context again: this is not a one-off incident, but something that has happened with startling frequency.<p>With the original title, it is easy to identify a through-line from the start of protests against the murder of George Floyd to a startling factual statement: on average, each day since then, police have attacked journalists over 20 times a day. Or to put it another way, police have attacked a journalist almost once an hour since the protests have begun.<p>That context is vital to the discussion, if as you say the headline has such an enormous impact on the conversation that follows. If, as I see in your recent edit, the distribution function is changed because the headline specifically calls out that high rate of attacks on journalists in a small window of time, then I think it moves that function for the better.",

That&#x27;s often a legit source title, along with the HTML doc title, and other places that articles tend to reveal what they&#x27;re actually about (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Adang%20url%20html%20doc%20title&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a>).<p>The reason I changed it is that &quot;U.S. police have attacked journalists more than 110 times since May 28&quot; is more baity. First you&#x27;ve got the aggressive verb &quot;attacked&quot;. And then you&#x27;ve got the specific facts and figures (100 times, May 28). Why do these things make a title more baity? I don&#x27;t know, but they are somehow active ingredients in the psychology of titles, which is why headline writers use them. I think of them as sharp edges. If you throw a spiky thing into a crowd, it gets more attention than a beach ball\u2014but the quality of attention is not conducive to a reflective discussion on the internet (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Adang%20reflective%20reflex&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a>). People react to the sharp bits.<p>It&#x27;s in HN&#x27;s interest to rewrite baity titles (indeed the site guidelines request it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>) but this is 1000x more important on inflammatory topics of the moment, like this one. We want HN to discuss this, but we want to support the discussion to stay in the intended spirit of the site: thoughtful, respectful, curious conversation. The material is provocative enough, and a title doesn&#x27;t need sharp edges to make readers here care about the topic.<p>To clear up a misconception that sometimes arises: I&#x27;m not saying the statement in the sharper title is false. Obviously it&#x27;s legitimate to use an aggressive verb to describe an aggressive action, and if the facts and figures are true then it&#x27;s obviously legitimate to make a factual statement with them. As a reader I have zero problem with that title. But the moderator perspective is different: the question for a moderator, on HN at least, is always: what is the prospective effect on forthcoming discussion? Or to put it pseudotechnically: given choice A vs. choice B, what is the diff between the probability distribution of threads that A is a prefix of, vs. threads that B is a prefix of? (This is just a metaphor, but it reflects how we think about this. See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Adang%20%22expected%20value%22&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a> for more.) In the case of these two alternative titles, experience has shown that there&#x27;s a significant difference in probable outcomes, and titles are by far the biggest influence on threads, so it&#x27;s potentially a big deal.",

And no business store owner will open a shop in a police-free district.<p>All these rioters for freedom and dignity are fine on the TV. When people are on the wrong side of the mob, they change their minds pretty quick.",

Someone made that up on social media and people shared it because that&#x27;s what people do.<p>The only video I know of showing officers breaking a window is out of Seattle. It shows officers responding to a burglary in progress at a Target store. The officers had to chip away at the <i>already broken</i> glass windows so they could safely get in. (The burglars had broken the glass to get inside.) Once inside, the responding officers found and arrested the three burglars they had come for.",

They may be deplored, but they are there and should be understood. Urban riots are a special form of violence. They are not insurrections. The rioters are not seeking to seize territory or to attain control of institutions. They are mainly intended to shock the white community. They are a distorted form of social protest. The looting which is their principal feature serves many functions. It enables the most enraged and deprived Negro to take hold of consumer goods with the ease the white man does by using his purse. Often the Negro does not even want what he takes; he wants the experience of taking. But most of all, alienated from society and knowing that this society cherishes property above people, he is shocking it by abusing property rights. There are thus elements of emotional catharsis in the violent act. This may explain why most cities in which riots have occurred have not had a repetition, even though the causative conditions remain. It is also noteworthy that the amount of physical harm done to white people other than police is infinitesimal and in Detroit whites and Negroes looted in unity.<p>A profound judgment of today\u2019s riots was expressed by Victor Hugo a century ago. He said, \u2018If a soul is left in the darkness, sins will be committed. The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but he who causes the darkness.\u2019<p>The policymakers of the white society have caused the darkness; they create discrimination; they structured slums; and they perpetuate unemployment, ignorance and poverty. It is incontestable and deplorable that Negroes have committed crimes; but they are derivative crimes. They are born of the greater crimes of the white society. When we ask Negroes to abide by the law, let us also demand that the white man abide by law in the ghettos. Day-in and day-out he violates welfare laws to deprive the poor of their meager allotments; he flagrantly violates building codes and regulations; his police make a mockery of law; and he violates laws on equal employment and education and the provisions for civic services. The slums are the handiwork of a vicious system of the white society; Negroes live in them but do not make them any more than a prisoner makes a prison. Let us say boldly that if the violations of law by the white man in the slums over the years were calculated and compared with the law-breaking of a few days of riots, the hardened criminal would be the white man. These are often difficult things to say but I have come to see more and more that it is necessary to utter the truth in order to deal with the great problems that we face in our society.&quot;",

The methods of protest are varied and of disproportionate impact to society. If protest is to succeed, social impact must be calibrated to the received response to protester demands. If no response or negative response is received, increase social impact to belligerent parties and the general public, if necessary. Protest without corresponding social impact is ineffectual at forcing the issue but can be effective in virtue-signaling, which can create a virtuous loop of increasing awareness and support, and increasing numbers of protesters.",

You&#x27;re very confused. You explicitly say we should not confuse protestors with rioters, and then go on to say that rioting and looting is being done by people &quot;within the protest movement&quot;. You can&#x27;t have it both ways. What you don&#x27;t seem to understand is that it can simultaneously be the case that there are people who are committing &quot;crimes&quot; to have their voices heard, and people who are committing crimes because it&#x27;s an opportune time to commit them. What you fail to recognize, is that we may disagree about what a crime even is societally. And to wit, that is exactly what we&#x27;re disagreeing about right now. By strict legal definition, looting is a crime. However, the motivation for the crime colors it. If someone was starving and stole a loaf of bread it would be a crime, but the motivations for that crime color it. I would not, for instance, tear gas a starving person for stealing a loaf of bread.<p>--\nIn the end, your version of &quot;clear-eyed&quot; is code for &quot;whatever I deem to be the valid laws of this society&quot;, not necessarily what is truly just.",

The protests are a direct result of the public not accepting the status quo anymore. The death of a person at the hands of the police started this fire. The police keep it going by aggressive unconstitutional protest containment actions. I don&#x27;t agree with you at all, and I have laid out the legal and social basis why you are wrong to believe what you do. If I have failed to convince you, I&#x27;m sorry. I tried and will keep trying. If you choose not to agree with my interpretation, that&#x27;s fine too.<p>Protest and looting are shades of the same idea. If you don&#x27;t care about us taking up space in your streets, maybe you may care about being deprived of your corporate assets. Corporations aren&#x27;t people. People are people. If harming corporations leads to an increase in human rights, that is a net gain for society. To question whether the cost is too high like you do shows you care more for property, capital, and the people who wield these asset classes, than you do for those who have cause to protest. Just because you don&#x27;t share their cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre does not invalidate it.<p>Reasonable people can disagree. It&#x27;s impossible to be reasonable or disagree if you&#x27;re killing someone or being killed. The police actions up to this point have been unreasonable, and so the response of the public is currently outside the scope of actions that can have a reasonableness standard applied to them. Protest is inherently justified by the Constitution. The response to police brutality and lack of internal reform proves the police think they are right to kill people and don&#x27;t need to change. That&#x27;s why the protests continue. To stop protesting now would be to negotiate with terrorists. The protests must continue as long and until the police come to the table with protesters and stakeholders, and they all negotiate a solution.",

I don\u2019t share this belief in Truth being knowable in the field. That\u2019s why police don\u2019t have unlimited latitude to identify criminals and respond to suspected criminal acts in the field. They must act within policing standards set by the community in stated and unstated ways. Otherwise, they may not have a job if the service they provide is made redundant through community involvement in legislatively changing police mandates, authority, and priorities.<p>But more to my point, police are not judges, lawyers, or most important, juries. They don\u2019t decide what is just. They just deliver those suspected of lawbreaking to the judicial system, which determines guilt or innocence under the law. As far as the legal system is concerned, everyone has presumption of innocence. The way you are characterizing people as looters or rioters is to say that what they are doing is unlawful, but that\u2019s just like your opinion, man. One person\u2019s rioter is another person\u2019s edgy protesting neighbor. It\u2019s for the courts to decide which behavior is law-abiding. If they aren\u2019t convicted, they were not found to be in violation of the law, yet. It\u2019s strange for you to presume they would found guilty just because you disagree with their actions.

Maybe the police should not use those things, but it&#x27;s more of a very specific question about safety.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The defenders are unknowingly or knowingly participating in a counter-protest movement against the current legitimate George Floyd protests. &quot;<p>There are a few things to unpack here:<p>&#x27;The defenders&#x27; if you mean police, then they are very lawfully authorized by you and I, the community, to move the rioters and looters out of the area, arrest them etc..

And we should also not confuse &#x27;protesters&#x27; with &#x27;rioters&#x27;.<p>As far as &#x27;right-wing narrative&#x27; - although that is true, if anyone can&#x27;t see that that there is a massive and systematic &#x27;social narrative&#x27; (left wing?) being driven by millions of participants, even those who should be neutral, is living in a bubble.<p>Most importantly - there is <i>rioting and looting</i>. This is not being done by the police, or by some secret Russians, this is being done by people within the protest movement and it&#x27;s clearly wrong. It&#x27;s definitely happening and it&#x27;s absolutely reasonable to point that out, and to do so is not to necessarily support some kind of narrative.<p>In fact, to not characterize rioters and looters as such, would be an offense against the truth, just as characterizing protesters standing on a corner with signs as &#x27;rioters&#x27; would be as well.<p>Because there are a lot of people driving narratives of some kind or another (pretty much every political force and most in the press), doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re entitled to just &#x27;go with it&#x27;, we have a responsibility to try to stay &#x27;clear-eyed&#x27;, perhaps more than ever.",

                        "text": "In any given group, you can\u2019t know with certainty whether past or future looters are present; looting is an action and not a quality. It is subjective.<p>Is removing anti-riot barricades \u2018looting\u2019 if protesters remove them from the street and out of the control of authorities in order to exercise their right to protest?<p>Branding someone a rioter empowers the utterer and subjugates the one deemed rioting in your framing. You seem to think it is justified to use violence against someone because of how you perceive their actions, even if they don\u2019t hurt people, only property. There is a subtle but distinct difference. Using force to defend yourself and others has a long precedent and is largely uncontroversial in a public context such as this. However, a citizen in public generally can\u2019t engage someone who is running away from them as they are not in imminent danger. Unless you think they are immediately returning with a weapon, you have to let them go once they get away or chase them and perform a citizen\u2019s arrest. Shooting a fleeing person is frowned upon by the courts. Only police have that authority.<p>Why then are citizens taking it upon themselves to prevent looting and rioting? Defending businesses and private property from the inside and the entryway is one thing. Chasing fleeing \u2018looters\u2019 is a situation for disaster. Besides mistaken identity, which is already causing defenders and protesters who fought looters to be detained by police while actual looters escape, there are problems with armed individuals running into crowds of undifferentiable groups of protesters, looters, and rioters. How will the defenders know when to stop beating people up? How will they know if the protester defending the person next to them from collateral damage isn\u2019t another looter? They will see what they want to see in the situation, on both sides.<p>Violence is not the way. I just don\u2019t see how property damage is a mortal harm that justifies what I\u2019m seeing. It may not be justified to damage the property, but as an individual or small group of defenders, there is no proportionality of response that makes sense against a large group of people. To start the fight is to lose on all sides. The protest will end when it ends. Lives shouldn\u2019t end through protest, or through its consequences. One was enough to start this one. There\u2019s a reason people do it, even if it may have knock-on effects. That\u2019s the point. To shutdown protest because of its intended and unintended consequences is to make a means test for our constitutional rights. It\u2019s not tolerated well in the streets or in the courtroom.<p>The defenders are unknowingly or knowingly participating in a counter-protest movement against the current legitimate George Floyd protests. It is being promoted through dog whistles by the right wing. It\u2019s actually really obvious that authoritarians aren\u2019t wasting this crisis. They start as many fires as they put out. I\u2019m including rioters in that last part.",

The way they see it, the only crimes worth their time involve people not committing real crimes at all or crimes involving guns or knives.  Anyone who doesn&#x27;t get why people don&#x27;t trust the police has been living under a rock.  This goes beyond just racism.",

The interesting stuff starts at 26&#x27; in, but he gives a lot of good context on the protest leading up to then.  The livestreamer was at the front line when they started pepper spraying, and in fact you can even see him in the aerial footage as he&#x27;s next to a pink umbrella that makes a good landmark.  It&#x27;s very clear from ground eye view the violence was deliberately premeditated and coordinated by SPD and not in response to any immediate threat.  No orders to disperse, or do anything else for that matter, are given prior to pepper spray, teargas, and flashbangs.<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;izaacmellow&#x2F;status&#x2F;1267679820600668161\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;izaacmellow&#x2F;status&#x2F;12676798206006...</a> - Official SPD story claiming incident is a &quot;riot&quot; and was forced on them: &quot; Crowd has thrown rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers and is attempting to breach barricades one block from the East Precinct.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think you can watch these videos and come to the conclusion that at least in this instance, it&#x27;s not the protesters rioting but rather the police.

There are many minutes of the interaction we don&#x27;t have insight into, in particular the moments leading up to the &#x27;kneeling&#x27;. That doesn&#x27;t mean the police are not lying, but it definitely means the &#x27;proof&#x27; offered by CNN is not &#x27;proof&#x27;.<p>Also, city coroner made one claim, the coroner hired by the family made a different one, the claim that somehow the coroner hired by the family is &#x27;correct&#x27; is just flat out inappropriate. Personally, I&#x27;m slightly more inclined to believe the city coroner, and that there were probably some complications. When the victim initially came out of his vehicle, it seems he fell to the ground in a manner that didn&#x27;t seem to be due to a struggle, which would indicate something was wrong, physically, already at that time, obviously exacerbated by the police brutality.",

Fire department got called to a shoe store fire, they faced some impediment reaching the fire, police showed up and dropped tear gas all over the area, and the fire department ended up back on the scanner requesting an ambulance for the commander on site for tear gas exposure, and additional PPE from another department to help the other fire fighters cope. The building ended up being marked a complete loss, although I&#x27;m unclear of the nitty gritty details like timelines, source of the fire, etc.<p>EDIT: I will also note that this, among other events, was used to justify calling for a curfew in town, and today, the mayor and police chief have condemned their own police officers for deploying tear gas on peaceful protests prior to the start of the curfews last night, and then putting forward a false justification (admitted by the police chief to have been a false justification, to be clear) for doing so.",

They won&#x27;t account for all of their CS deployments, which I think is crazy, but they did address why it started the other day (Saturday?). Their claim is that what they saw was some police inside the city&#x2F;county building and a single person started hitting the glass on the building. Simultaneously, &quot;previously peaceful&quot; protesters started locking arms at one end of the street, blocking emergency vehicle ingress, so they let loose a bunch of (13 year expired)_CS gas.<p>Is that believable? Sure, but locking arms is also a common thing during protests. The road was already blocked off and cars weren&#x27;t going through. Also, they fired CS into crowds of protesters blocks away, claiming that they think the protesters are coordinating by secure communications and instantaneously turning violent across the city. Most of it seems like bullshit, and even if it&#x27;s all true, locking arms on one side of a closed street is not at all unusual. They should have arrested the one guy hitting the glass and let the protest continue.<p>By the way, they used this event to justify the curfews that haven&#x27;t been raised since then.",

                        "text": "&quot;Monopoly on violence&quot; or &quot;use of force&quot; is the way I&#x27;ve seen it put by political scientists defining what it means for a state to be sovereign (that quality is really high up the list of things that go along with that). It doesn&#x27;t mean only the state can legally engage in, say, violent self-defense, but it means the state is capable of dictating <i>where and when</i> &quot;legitimate&quot; violence may occur, and backing up those dictates with its own violence, with great effectiveness.<p>Not that this means a sovereign state may choose to make violent self-defense legal, for example, without any risk to its sovereignty, provided it&#x27;s still the force deciding whether a given instance was legal and backing up those rulings with threat of or actual violence. It&#x27;s the unchallenged (un-<i>successfully</i> challenged, at any rate) arbiter of what is and is not permissible violence.<p>The police are the primary point of contact between the citizenry and the state monopoly on violence when it is most acutely exercised (rather than merely threatened or practiced more softly), so framing this as the police personally having (been invested with) that monopoly, in the context of a meeting on the street between non-police citizens and the police, seems reasonable to me.<p>A state that finds itself unable to claim or maintain its monopoly on violence is at serious risk of loss of sovereignty, usually to whichever group is having success challenging that claim. Understanding how that balance sits can be a way to insight into the <i>de facto</i> power structure of a governmental system\u2014for example, the <i>de jure</i> sovereign power of a state might be the civil government, but if it <i>effectively</i> operates at the pleasure of a military bureaucracy that has demonstrated the ability to topple the civil government and maintains a tacit threat to do same again in the future, then at best the civil government shares sovereignty with the military bureaucracy, and at worst it&#x27;s a kind of puppet-state of the actual sovereign power (this, specifically, is why strong standing armies are seen as a risky tool for a state to keep\u2014rather than increasing the power or control of the supposed sovereign, they can easily turn to challenging it very effectively). Turkey&#x27;s operated this way, at times. Egypt, too. Not that uncommon an arrangement, the <i>de facto</i> sovereignty resting less securely with the <i>de jure</i> rulers than one might suppose.<p>Looking elsewhere in the thread, reports of police <i>deliberately</i> failing to use their (threat of or actual) force to uphold the law in the districts of politicians who&#x27;ve tried to do something they don&#x27;t like (reduce their funding)\u2014assuming they get away with it and aren&#x27;t brought to-heel (apparently they have not been)\u2014is another example of a force-bearing arm of the state threatening the sovereignty of the civil government.<p>[EDIT] on a more personal note, I&#x27;m <i>highly</i> skeptical of the utility of widespread private ownership of small arms as a means of keeping the state in check. I&#x27;ve not seen them to be a significant factor in successful resistance against a state, and <i>especially</i> not against one&#x27;s own state. For one thing they&#x27;re plenty likely to be used to <i>enforce</i> tyranny or perpetrate injustice on behalf of the government, officially or unofficially (often the latter\u2014see the post-reconstruction South for a close-to-home example) and for another they seem to be neither necessary nor sufficient for armed insurrection to succeed. The critical factor seems to be overt or covert support by part or all of an actual military, whether foreign or one&#x27;s own, to provide materiel and direct support (e.g. no-fly zones, factions of the army joining the rebels in a civil war, that sort of thing). I see them as a distraction. I wish the left would stop talking about them because it just drives some people away and they&#x27;ve made little progress on restricting firearm ownership anyway, but I also don&#x27;t see them as somehow key to preserving liberty, simply because they seem secondary at best in any successful rebellion I&#x27;m aware of (except maybe against <i>very</i> weak states with tiny militaries that fail to levy more loyal soldiers before the shooting starts, but that&#x27;s not, you know, the US, at all).",

Many of the others who spoke were calmer, more reasonable, more positive, sincere, etc, but she was trying to get people ramped up. The police weren&#x27;t at the protest originally and she tried to use the lack of police presence to anger people (&quot;look, the police don&#x27;t even care about protecting you!&quot;) and then they merely showed up and it was the other way around (&quot;the police are here to stop us!&quot;). Seemed like she was trying to agitate people into provoking the police. Even still, the protest was generally peaceful on both sides; as far as I know, there was no police violence nor rioting&#x2F;looting&#x2F;etc. Proud of my hood.",

Easy answer, the support where the money comes from. People decry corporate money in politics but this money is more poisonous because of its out sized influence because of pressure they can put on any politician who tries to stand up to them; just go google stories of these unions protesting in the streets of the homes of politicians making moves against them, they have bought billboards and even homes nearby to put pressure down.<p>TL,DR : This is all about money. The politicians have been more than willing to turn a blind eye to police malfeasance; if not problems in fire departments and education; because the money is too good and the groups involved have very big influence over the citizenry.",

That&#x27;s one piece. None of those people need to be in jail. They haven&#x27;t been convicted of a crime and they overwhelmingly show up for their court date if released. The only thing they can&#x27;t afford is their bail and that is used to get them to plead to crimes without the police having to prove anything. That&#x27;s 470k people on any given night. *<p>Drug possession. Like to smoke weed? Well, that&#x27;s your choice and no need to throw you in jail over it like 1.4 million people each year. <i></i><p>The other pieces are more radical or require replacement programs or just don&#x27;t even have proposed solutions. But  just above are two pieces of the incarceration system that the many people will agree could just be turned off.<p>So, if you turn those off, what&#x27;s the staffing change in police departments and correctional facilities? We&#x27;re not talking about firing for performance (yet), this is just run of the mill right sizing. Gotta be efficient--can&#x27;t give people jobs as a handout.<p>What if you kept going down this line of reasoning. What if you ended racial profiling? Across the country black motorists are 20% more likely to be pulled over<i></i><i>. Either black people are being targeted (the consensus) or white people are being given a free pass (my personal experience is that this is also happening). So either hire more police to pull over white people more often. We are doing hella drugs, driving drunk all the time, texting while driving, etc. Or, more along the lines of what everyone wants, there could be a 20% reduction in the staffing of highway patrol.<p>I think if the will of the people was respected, police departments would probably be reduced by 25% across the country. Certainly in NYC, which has one of the highest cops per capita in the world even though we have the highest density and cops shouldn&#x27;t have to walk far to do their jobs.<p>If it were my policy though, probably 50% of police could be eliminated.<p></i> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prisonpolicy.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;pie2020.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prisonpolicy.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;pie2020.html</a><p><i></i> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugpolicy.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;drug-war-statistics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugpolicy.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;drug-war-statistics</a><p><i></i>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;21&#x2F;us&#x2F;police-stops-race-stanford-study-trnd&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;21&#x2F;us&#x2F;police-stops-race-stanford...</a>",

And if the police show up <i>their</i> lives are at imminent risk.  So the cops have to show up and they have to wear riot gear.<p>I&#x27;ve had to live with months of protest downtown.  People protesting to release prisoners because of coronavirus.  People protesting to lift the coronavirus lock downs.  In those cases there was no riot gear.  Minimal police presence.  When Friday&#x27;s protest came around it immediately <i>felt</i> different.  The people were much more angry and much more hostile.<p>People were looking at the Minneapolis riots with envy.  People were shouting about the righteous cause of riots and looting.  &quot;Its the language of the unheard.&quot;  Despite noble protestations that they were only going to loot the wealthy corporations with fat insurance contracts, they ended up looting everything.  They ended up shooting each other far from police lines.  They ended up burning police cars that were parked far away from police lines.  They lit buildings on fire that could have very easily spread to neighboring apartment buildings.<p>You said:<p>&gt; nothing about CPDs behavior looked like &quot;keep people safe&quot;<p>I disagree.  &quot;People&quot; are more than just the rioters.

            "text": "I&#x27;ve had the opposite experience in Chicago.  I live in a high rise in the loop.  I was able to watch the &quot;protests&quot;, &quot;riots&quot;, whatever from above.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get flagged but these are my honest impressions on the behavior of the CPD and the protestors.<p>My biggest takeaway is local events translate to global action in the crowd (police or protestors).  And it leads to all this misunderstanding.  &quot;What I was just standing here.  Why are you pushing me?&quot;.  Because jackass, a group of people 10 feet away from you threw rocks and bottles at the police.  Sorry you got shoved but shit happens.<p>Below are my unorganized thoughts.  Just wanted to get them out.<p>---<p>There were like 100k people at 2:30 (maybe more I didn&#x27;t count I&#x27;m just guessing).  These people were mostly peaceful.  The worst thing they did was chant obscenities about the police and jump on the cars of bystanders.  Not the worst thing in the world but not the nicest way to protest either.  I don&#x27;t hold it against them.<p>By 6ish there were maybe 10 or 20 thousand hardcore protestors remaining.  The people legitimately concerned about police brutality but not clinically-insane-enough-to-march-for-four-hours-saying-the-same-thing-to-no-one-in-particular went home.<p>These diehards are mostly a bunch of power tripping assholes.  &quot;Fuck 12&quot;, &quot;ACAB&quot;, &quot;Pigs&quot;, running up to the police line and trying to &#x27;punk&#x27; them out.  Just stupid.  The weaker and frailer they are the more it seemed they had to say.  They know they have all the power when they&#x27;re with the crowd.  Its simultaneously the most pathetic and the most terrifying thing you&#x27;ve ever seen because one of these cracked out weirdos is probably going to try to light your building on fire soon.<p>And then the fires start.  Police cars, a 7-11, doesn&#x27;t matter.  The protestors block the street when firefighters roll up to put it out.  They eventually move but I couldn&#x27;t tell you why.  Big shoutout to CFD for being total badasses.  I wasn&#x27;t about to walk out in the crowd even if I were disguised as a &quot;protestor&quot;.  They make their way to the fire, get it out ASAP and roll out before the crowd has a chance to completely engulf them.  Though I never saw the bulk of the crowd leave the police lines.<p>I have to criticize CPD a little here.  I was legitimately concerned my wife and I were going to burn to death in our apartment.  I didn&#x27;t have faith that the CPD could prevent someone from lighting my building on fire.<p>Thankfully it never came to that.<p>The police were completely outnumbered and were generally powerless to do anything when the crowd was in its full force.  There were people with hammers breaking up the sidewalk to use chunks of debris as weapons against the police.  The police just stood there unable or unwilling to prevent it.<p>In my mind, the police were present to A). soak up as much of the crowds rage as possible and B). prevent the really heinous shit from going down.  I&#x27;m not talking murder.  I&#x27;m talking burning an apartment building down with all the people inside heinous.  Several murders happened behind the crowds (i.e. bad people are using the crowd as a human shield to do whatever they want).  The police didn&#x27;t (maybe couldn&#x27;t) budge.  Even if they did try to prevent it the crowd would have raged at their intrusion into &quot;their&quot; space.<p>After curfew the cops went on the offensive.  The police began to march.  Pushing the remaining &quot;protestors&quot; further and further south outside of the loop.  This involved rubber bullets and I assume tear gas but I couldn&#x27;t actually see this part.  Along the way the rioters looted <i>every</i> business (aside from the Crocs store hilariously enough) from Wacker all the way to Roosevelt.  I assume they looted further down but I didn&#x27;t feel like walking any further through the ruins of my city.<p>That&#x27;s basically it.",

However, if true, it does prompt us to ask if police can find ways to localize their responses better.  i.e. If violent response is necessary in a specific location, is there a way to make police relatively far from that location aware of it <i>without</i> signalling imminent personal danger to them, thereby priming them to over-respond to whatever is happening at their location?<p>e.g. Instead of just hearing &quot;They&#x27;ve pulled out knives!&quot; over the radio, they might have a corresponding heads-up display showing <i>where</i> that message came from and where they themselves are in relation to that.",

            "text": "The following is a heartfelt text that one of my friends in my PhD program sent. She wishes this to be shared to raise awareness, so I&#x27;m sharing here for people who might not have a good understanding of the context. This is related to the relationship between the American police and the black populace, so imo relevant in this context.<p>&quot;Sorry for this lengthy message but here goes: My ancestors are African and Native American. My African ancestors were taken from Africa, brought here to America, beat and killed, and forced to be slaves since the late 1600s. Of course as slaves you have no rights, so my great-great grandmother was raped, which is how my my branch of the family came about. So I actually have white and black ancestors. The Civil War occurred, which most people think the north fought to help free slaves, but actually the north just didn&#x27;t want the south to have slaves anymore because it was giving the south an economic advantage - not because they wanted to free black people. And although the north won, no one told slaves in the south this for many years, so they had no idea because they were not allowed to read. But eventually the word was spread and black people learned that they were technically free, but they could not own land, so they had no where to go. A few more benevolent slave masters gave some land to the slaves because, like my ancestors they were raped by the slave master and therefore the kids were part-family. This is why you see different shades of black people in America. My grandfather (born 1920) was forced to flee Texas as a young boy in fear for his life. He could&#x27;ve been another Emit Till. If you don&#x27;t know who Emit Till is, please, please just search the name. It will break your heart (Also sidenote: the woman who was the cause of the Emit Till murder announced on her deathbed that she lied about it all). Moving along...so my grandfather moved to Detroit where things were just a little better for black people. He was the only black person in his engineering program at Michigan State, and endured brutality and abuse for just trying to get an education. Then we had WW2 where he was not allowed to vote or have rights, but served as a Tuskegee Airman, a troup of all black pilots who literally saved America&#x27;s ass from Germany. If it were not for the Tuskegee Airman, we would have lost WW2. But he comes back after the war, and still has no rights, no freedoms. Blacks and whites were segregated and when black people made our own financial district and economy it was burned to the ground because it threatened white capitalism (see 1921 burning of black wallstreet in Tulsa Oklahoma). And then Jim Crow laws were put into place. Basically this meant that white people could legally discriminate against black people, which also included violent acts without repercussions. POLICE were created during this time to literally &quot;police&quot; black people because the slave masters did not have control anymore. So police did the slave master&#x27;s dirty work and it was still legal. This is why people are protesting against police brutality with a focus on black lives. Because the police were specifically created to take our lives, but not the lives of others. And you can see this today, for example George Floyd. So when people say &quot;all lives matter&quot; it is just another way of covering up the real reason police were created, and it hurts that 400 years later we are still trying to get justice, within a country that we literally built with our black hands. We are the economy, which is why when we created our own economy, it rocked the US economy so much that they burned it down. We have tried to march peacefully, we have tried to kneel peacefully, we have tried to protest peacefully, and it has gotten us nowhere. So that is why many people feel that the only option left to make our voices heard is to hurt the economy. And that&#x27;s what the rioting and looting is about. I&#x27;m not saying I condone it, but believe me, I understand it. Also if you have been following any of it, the vast majority of people being violent and breaking things are not black people, but actually white supremacists who dress up as protesters. They are trying to make black people seem violent so that the police take violent action against the protestors. Things are never as simple as they seem, so you have to know the history to understand the full scope if the situation, and guess what....they took the real history out of the textbooks! So yes, this is a heavy time for black people and I hope you all can start to understand why this is happening. Thank you for reading and being open-minded.&quot;",

They feel so threatened by the people that just having protesters get close to a fence around the Justice Center will cause police to start firing rubber bullets, flash bangs, smoke bombs, and tear gas at unarmed and unprotected protesters. Police feel so threatened by unarmed protesters that they now need the help of fully-armed, fully-geared, completely decked-out national guard. This is an embarrassment for police.<p>Not that any of this is a surprise, anyway.

Second, innocent people are getting killed by the rioting.<p>Third, there are people who would support police reform but are also terrified of looters and rioters.

            "text": "Some has to do with the police tactic of breaking up protests by lining up in riot gear and marching towards a crowd advancing and then clearing the area in front of them with tear gas. (the example of this was breaking up an after-curfew protest in Minneapolis in front of a police station, the night after a different station had burned to the ground).  Their goal seemed to be to disburse the crowd and arrest a few people as possible.<p>The next night their tactics changed, for the better, a similar after-curfew protest group was warned, given time, and everybody remaining was encircled by a close knit line of police and every single person was arrested.  The second tactic had a much better outcome, it seemed.<p>There were reporters stationed on the outskirts of the crowd but between the crowd and police, and I saw some of them get teargassed. In that case it had more to do with wind and proximity than being targeted. Much different than police actively going after reporters, but sources like this one don&#x27;t seem to differentiate between collateral damage from proximity and direct targeting of media teams.<p>Also, police in gas masks, partially for tear gas protection, partially for covid protection, facing crowd who at times have attacked police, they can&#x27;t see very well, they are under enormous amounts of stress, and few of them have experience doing anything like this... if you pull back from the blame,  talking about rights and duties, and just focus for a minute on the humanity... ask yourself how are these people going to fail? You&#x27;d probably come up with a lot of the ways the police indeed <i>are</i> failing.  Now in the same context think of how those failures could be reduced without thinking about blame... and it&#x27;s hard.  It&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>Just like failures in a tech stack and a team of programmers, <i>blame</i> is not the path to solving problems.  You don&#x27;t go find the guy who wrote the bug and shout at him or send him to jail or fire him or string him up in the public square, you write unit tests, you write post-mortems, you make backups, you make new monitors...  in short you find the sources of problems, you investigate them, and you solve them.  That sort of thought about failure needs to happen more in software, and it needs to happen more in the rest of life too.  Recognizing failures, having empathy for those who fail, realizing the source of those failures is systematic, and working on systematic solutions.",

If the police think 1 in 100 (rounding a bit) belong in jail, it leads to a very different quality of interaction if it is 1 in 1,000.<p>Definitely agree on the issues with accountability.",

There are many people in jail waiting trial for crimes they did not commit, simply because they could not afford bail and would not take a plea deal.<p>Ending the use of private prisons and restricting police use of military equipment and weapons are also frequently suggested proposals.<p>In terms of police violence, I think the main thing lacking right now is accountability.  There are a lot of ways to impose that.  One avenue is to impose accountability from a higher level of government (for instance: the FBI getting involved if local government doesn&#x27;t act), and the other traditional approach is accountability from voters.",

        "text": "I have been trying to think of good, relatively simple policy decisions that can make a large impact. I have not heard too many proposed besides removing qualified immunity. I would be curious what ideas people have:<p>Ideas include:\n-Banning police unions\n-Having a federal agency to discipline police (outside the purview of local politics)<p>I haven&#x27;t heard this idea elsewhere but I like the idea of us addressing from the top down the fact that we have the highest incarceration rate in the world at 698 per 1,000 currently. This is something like 10x some comparable countries, and at least 3x any country we consider &quot;free&quot; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_incarceration_rate#Comparison_with_other_countries\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_incarceration_ra...</a>). We can make a top down decision to change this by making a hard &quot;200 incarcerated per 100,000&quot; cap at the state level. Dec 31st of each year, each state with over 200 per 100,000 prisoners has to release prisoners until they are below the threshold.<p>I am not saying it is a simple problem, but any other solution ideas?",
